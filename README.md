**Create Your Own Illustrated Aidventure with AI**

Aiventura is an interactive storytelling app designed for children and teens.

## How It Works

1.  **User Input:** The child enters their name, age, and the desired number of story interactions.
2.  **Story Beginning:** The app prompts the user to start their imaginative tale.
3.  **AI Storytelling & Choices:** The AI continues the narrative and presents three distinct options for the user to choose the next path.
4.  **Image Generation:** Following the final interaction, an image is generated based on the complete story narrative.
5.  **PDF Creation:** The generated story and illustration are combined to produce a downloadable PDF document.
